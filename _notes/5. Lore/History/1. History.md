# History

Many centuries ago, the land was rules by Dragons.  Dragons of all colours took control of all things.  The 2 of the Dragons brought war to the land bringing death and destruction to the 2 main factions of the world.

[[Dracor]]   & [[Zemrog]]  lead the 2 factions.

[[Dracor]] was killed during the war

[[Zemrog]]'s faction ultimately became victorious.  [[Zemrog]] was named a hero of the Dragonkin.  [[Zemrog]] rules over the land now and protects all within the land, as long as they pay tribute to him.

[[dragonborn |Dragonborn]]  now rule at the local levels with there being a hierarchy in place:

Gold & Red - ruling clan
Greens - politicians
white & silver bottom of the pile

The land is administered by the [[Council of Scales]] 

There is a rumour of a prophecy that [[Dracor]] will return - this is viewed as either the end of the world or it's saving.
